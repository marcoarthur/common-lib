# Common Universe

The idea of common is to create several objects and relations that we see
as common when talking to a basic Object Oriented Software design.
So we try to give them common expected attributes. Such as a basic UML
data system. Mostly likely will always contains users, and several relations
such as:

A person is a user, a user can have multiple roles, etc..
